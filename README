pyweave - A single-file Mozilla Weave server
--------------------------------------------

Mozilla Weave is a Firefox extension that allows you to synchronize (among
other things) your bookmarks, open tabs, and preferences, across different
computers.

To do so, it stores the information on a server. The most popular server is
Mozilla's, but you can also use your own.

This project is a simple server implementation, that aims to be simple to set
up, have no requirements besides a CGI-enabled http server and a recent enough
Python, and scale well for a small number of users.


Installation procedure
----------------------

 - Copy pyweave.cgi somewhere inside your web directory where it can run (and
   make sure it has execution permissions).
 - mkdir <data_dir>; chown www-data:www-data <data_dir>
   where data_dir is a directory to use to store the data (must not be
   available via web, for obvious security reasons), and www-data is the
   username/group your httpd runs as.
 - cp config.py.sample config.py; $EDITOR config.py
   to set <data_dir>

There is no user administration or web interface of any kind. To add a user
named "asdf", add it to your httpd auth file, and then:

 - mkdir <data_dir>/asdf
 - chown www-data:www-data <data_dir>/asdf


To configure weave to use this servers, go to the preferences and set the
server to

	https://your_server/path/to/pyweave.cgi/

And that's it.
